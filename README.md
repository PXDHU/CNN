# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This repository contains my implementations of CNNs for image classification tasks, created as part of my learning journey. Through these projects, I explored both **binary image classification** and **multiclass image classification**. Below, I'll share insights and key concepts I learned along the way.

## What I Learned About CNNs

### 1. **Basic Concept of CNNs**
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a type of deep neural network designed to handle image data. Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs utilize layers specifically designed to capture spatial hierarchies in images. Key components include:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to extract features like edges, textures, and shapes.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features (commonly through max pooling).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Flatten the data and perform classification based on the extracted features.

### 2. **Why Use CNNs?**
CNNs are ideal for image classification because they:
- Automatically detect important features (like edges or patterns) from images without manual feature engineering.
- Are spatially invariant, meaning the position of an object in an image does not drastically affect classification.
- Are computationally efficient for large images compared to fully connected networks.

### 3. **Binary Image Classification**
In this task, I built a CNN to classify images into two categories (e.g., "cat" vs. "dog"). Key learning points:
- **Loss Function**: For binary classification, I used the **binary cross-entropy** loss.
- **Output Layer**: A **single sigmoid neuron** was used for output, representing probabilities for the two classes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Proper image resizing, normalization, and augmentation were essential to improve generalization.
  
### 4. **Multiclass Image Classification**
For this task, I built a CNN to classify images into multiple categories (e.g., handwritten digits). Key takeaways:
- **Loss Function**: I used **categorical cross-entropy** for multiclass classification.
- **Output Layer**: A **softmax output layer** was implemented, which provides a probability distribution across the multiple classes.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping helped enhance model robustness by generating more diverse training examples.

### 5. **Model Optimization and Evaluation**
Throughout both projects, I learned to:
- **Optimize Models**: Using optimizers like **Adam** to adjust weights and biases efficiently.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Implementing **dropout** to prevent overfitting.
- **Metrics**: Evaluate models using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix** to ensure proper performance assessment.

### 6. **Key Challenges**
- **Overfitting**: Early on, I struggled with overfitting, especially in smaller datasets. This taught me the importance of regularization, dropout layers, and data augmentation.
- **Choosing Hyperparameters**: Deciding the right number of filters, kernel size, and number of layers was initially challenging. I experimented with different architectures to understand the trade-offs.
